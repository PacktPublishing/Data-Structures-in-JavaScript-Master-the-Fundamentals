// Create class called Calendar that uses a Linked List
// to keep track of months and days. The Calendar class
// should manually construct itself as a LinkedList with
// 12 nodes, one for each month of the year. Each node
// should know how many days are in the month. The Calendar
// class should be able to keep track of the current month
// and day and have a .nextDay() method that progresses the
// current state to the next day.
